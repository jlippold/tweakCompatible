  "shortDescription": "An awesome folder tweak for making custom layouts, color blurred backgrounds, adjusting the opacity, size, corner radius, gradient colors, and other properties of folders, their icons, and background views. It has color pickers for open and closed folders, their borders, and sliders to set thickness of borders. FCXIII also offers an image picker to add custom images inside folders, and an alpha slider to adjust how much or little color goes on top of it.  Multi-select option for fast re-arranging of icons plus other useful features. This is a work-in-progress beta primarily made for iOS 13, but most features also work on iOS 11 and 12 for all devices.",
